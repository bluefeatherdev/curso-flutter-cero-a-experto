  A Flutter application demonstrating clean architecture principles with The Movie Database (TMDb) API integration.
  This project showcases Riverpod state management, GoRouter navigation, Material Design 3 theming, and proper
  separation of concerns between domain, data, and presentation layers. Features paginated movie lists, animated
  carousels, and reactive state management with complete abstraction between API contracts and domain entities.
  Implements best practices for scalable Flutter application architecture with dependency injection patterns,
  environment configuration management, and reusable widget components.
